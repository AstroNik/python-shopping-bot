# Python Shopping Bot

Use Cases are for Amazon and Besbuy

Because of Computer Part Storage and the difficulty to purchase products I create a bot that could potentailly buy products for you.

Can be any product on either site.

To Be Tested:
1. How long the bot can run without crashing
2. Running multiple instances of the bot so you can watch multiple prodcuts
3. Containerize application
4. Run on cloud to see if it still works (headless mode)

Pros:
1. Can get whatever you want quickly
2. Can watch products for you and potentailly beat other bots to buying the item

Con:
1. Not ethical
